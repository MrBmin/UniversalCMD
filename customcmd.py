#Use this file to create your own commands.
#
#INSTRUCTIONS:
#Create a function named after your command, the arguments of the function are the
#arguments of your command
#
#Here's an example:
#def greet(arg):
#  print(f"Hello, {arg}!")
#  return
#
#To use it, you would type in the following command:
#custom greet Bob
#And it should output the following:
#Hello, Bob!
#
#Heads up, at the moment, custom commands have a maximum of 2 arguments, (e.g. custom cmd 1 2)
#I'm working on a way to get infinite arguments, that should be out soon.
#
#(Try to) have fun!
