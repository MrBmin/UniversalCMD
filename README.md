# UniversalCMD
*STILL W.I.P, CURRENT MAJOR VERSION IS PRE-ALPHA 0.0*

UniversalCMD is a Python re-creation of the Windows command prompt, that works on all platforms (that is, ones that can run Python lol)!

I'm still working on pre-alpha, so be patient as I (try) to iron out all the bugs!
Also, I'm a beginner to Python, so this is my first big project with it, so everything might be a bit overwhelming to me so don't pressure me to make updates every 10 seconds.
